## import-csv : CLI (Command Line Interface)

**CLI** was builted to import a *.csv* file containing all products related data, to populate
the database (MongoDB) used on this project.

### Installing Dependencies

Go to folder *WebJumpTest/cli*:

```bash
$ cd cli/
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Enable this project globally on your machine (using *npm*):

> This command enables to execute the *import-csv* command in anywhere on your machine.

```bash
$ npm link
```

> ATTENTION: Run the command only on *CMD* or *bash*, i don't why, but doesn't work on *Windows Powershell*.

### Importing CSV File

To import a csv from a path, run the command, inform a full path to a .csv file:

```bash
$ import-csv

$ ? Inform the .csv file path to import => C:\complete\path\to\yout\file\products.csv

* Initializing read process...: 8.020ms

* Initializing products and categories transformation (spliting)...: 6.033ms

* Initializing categories transformation (to model pattern)...: 1.214ms

* Deleting all data from Products and Categories database...: 38.261ms

* Inserting all Category data readed to Categories database...: 32.500ms

* Transforming categories on products to valid _id attribute...: 59.718ms

* Inserting all Product data readed to Products database...: 701.231ms

** Categories inserted -> 20
** Products inserted -> 1000
```

#### CLI Validations
